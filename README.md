# DailyRP_SOURCE_CODE

This is the source code for my unreleased server "DailyRP" which I've been working on for many many months with a small team of friends. Life responsibilities took over and I could never finish or start this server. Anyway I figured I just release this source code and let the community enjoy the work or get some ideas about what they might want to potentially use on their server.

## FIRSTLY

First thing is first, to clear everything up, majority of the scripts that are in this Source Code are from other author's and repos. Many of them I have absolutely no right over and I am not selling or claiming any copyright, I am simply putting it all in one pack as I've used them and they were used on my server. I will attempt to reference as many sources as I remember but feel free to PR and add your credits if necessary (see bottom of Readme)

## SECONDLY

This upload is very outdated, last time I've worked on FiveM was end of Summer 2018 therefore I am not responsible for any instability caused by the scripts or anything not working as well with current updates. ALSO, I will not be providing any support for anything found in this pack (or very limited see FAQ), I've provided the whole source code I've used and worked with as well as the SQL file for the DB I've used. If there is a file missing or I've forgotten to upload something please put it in help section and I will add it to the repo. Lastly, I have not cleaned up the pack so its a fucking mess like I left it when I stopped working on FiveM. There is a lot of scripts and code that is not even used and its all referenced in server.cfg

## THIRDLY

You should at this point know how to set up a server and how to configure the whole thing so dont ask me for help there are plenty of tutorials online dont be lazy look for one. ALSO Few files are missing because they exceed the maximum size for GitHub those will be listed after Credits :)

# INFO
